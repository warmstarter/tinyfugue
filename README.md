# tinyfugue
TinyFugue, the classic MU* client Modernized.

The 'pre-release' branch is where development is currently happening.

The 'pythong-scripting' branch now supports Python 2.7 and 3 and will
be merged into pre-release after some more testing.

There are a number of features and bug fixes in there.
It's probably the most stable version of TF out there.

Once it's been fully cleaned-up and packaged, it will
move to the main branch.
