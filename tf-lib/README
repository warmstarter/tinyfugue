                   Interesting and useful macros

The *.tf files in this directory contain many interesting and useful
macros.  Some are quite useful, others illustrate useful macro
programming techniques.  Any of the *.tf files can be loaded directly
with /load.  Read the comments at the top of each file for specific
instructions.

=============================================================================

Newly added:

    utilities.tf
      - The TF Mailing List's library of missing functions.
    *.py
      - Python scripts available with --enable-python
        These were initially created for Python2, so some might not work if
        you are using Python3. They are loaded differently.
        See: /help python

=============================================================================

Removed:

    tintin.tf
      - Outdated, would server no real use and not worth updating
