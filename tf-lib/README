                   Interesting and useful macros

The *.tf files in this directory contain many interesting and useful
macros.  Some are quite useful, others illustrate useful macro
programming techniques.  Any of the *.tf files can be loaded directly
with /load.  Read the comments at the top of each file for specific
instructions.

=============================================================================

Newly added:

    utilities.tf
      - The TF Mailing List's library of missing functions.
    *.py
      - Python scripts available with --enable-python
        These were initially created for Python2, so some might not work if
        you are using Python3. They are loaded differently.
        See: /help python

=============================================================================

Removed:

Outdated .tf files have been removed.
Symlinks for old names of .tf files have been removed.
Scripts should be updated to use the new names.
Previously both were valid, now only the proper name will work.
Most are likely already using these new naw names.

If for some reason you need the old names, you can manually create them with
a symlink: ln -s <canonical name> <legacy name>

Deprecated files can always be found in github epo archive, but are
likely out-of-date and not supported.
